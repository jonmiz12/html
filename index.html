					Hello, my name is Jonathan, I've started learning code and software around 4 years ago.
					<br>I am a professional bass player, I used to take part in recording, performing and composing of songs in my band.
					<br>About 2 years ago I started QA courses - manual and automation.
					<br>After the courses I started my first role as a manual QA for a gaming company. I've been working there for abit over a year.
					<br>My next goal is to study the automation world as best as I can and eventually get hired into an automation dev position.
					<br><br>Thank you for reading this far.
					<br>Enjoy the rest of site.
